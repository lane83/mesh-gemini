Use this script to connect a Meshtastic channel to the Gemini API.

Edit mesh-gemini.py in your favorite text editor.

Update the API_KEY, TARGET_CHANNEL, and HOST

Save it and close.

chmod +x to make it executable.

Now your machine will talk to your Meshtastic node. 

There are several more MQTT settings to mess with but for now I've enabled everything I could find under Lora and Channel configurations to get it to work.
I will be revising these notes once I figure out what is necessary.
